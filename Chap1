public static void main(String args[]){ }
main method is the main entery point of the Java program. 
the class is declared main method or not it will not check compiler. only JVM is resposible to check when runinig the Java 
program. if main method is not declared in class runtime exception throws NosuchmethodError: main - Runtime Exception
why main method public- To call JVM anyware in the program
why main method static- withouot exsting object also JVM has to call main method & nothing relationship with any object with 
main method
why main method void - main method must not return values to JVM
why main method main -  this is name configure inside the JVM
why main method String args[] - command line arguemnts
There are some changes we can modify with the main method
* order of the visiblity modifiers insteand of public ststic can call static public
* changes of the command line argument - String []args,String[] args, String args[], String... args, String a[]
* changes with following optional specifiers- final, strictfp, synchoronized
changing main mathod without above acceptable changes will generate runtime exception. No compiler error.
